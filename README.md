Backport of Asp.Net core's policy based authorization to Asp.Net 4. The original ASP.NET core source code from which this project is based upon is available on GitHub [here]( https://github.com/aspnet/Security).

Owin-Authorization provides both declarative and imperative authorization functionality to enable you to limit access to MVC or Web Api controllers and actions based upon the role or claims an identity contains, and the resource being requested.
